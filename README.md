# CS305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
- Artimis Financial is a financial consulting company that was looking to upgrade their custom software to modernize with the latest and most secure software security practices.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
- I felt I did well in identifying vulnerabilities and implementing encryption algorithm cipher to the software application. Secure coding is a way to ensure data is protected in your software application. Software security is important for the company's reputation to build trust with their clients and would likely fail without proper security measures. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
- The dependency check tool is both challenging and helpful, it took a while to understand how to use it but after understanding it better and seeing what it can do it would be an important step in testing software in the future. 

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
- Security is different by industry, given that Artimis Financial would deal with more attacks than software that doesn't hold financial information, it has higher security needs. This allows us to add more layers of security as it will be needed, that was one issue that was taken into account when determining the appropriate algorithm cipher. 

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- By running a vulnerability check before and after changes were implemented we could see that no new vulnerabilities were introduced to the refactored code. To ensure the code was functional and secure it was compiled and ran to check for the expected result. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- Using secure coding practices and the dependency check tool were highly beneficial in the process, I will likely implement these practices in future projects. For resources I was able to use material that was provided as well as internet research to learn more effective ways of securing software applications.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
- This assignment showcases my ability to follow requirements to enhance security to an existing software application. It also highlights my skills in assessment and finding proper solutions to existing issues.
